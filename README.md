# ProFile-Applet
ProFile for Dynatrace using Java v8 and Scene Builder

ProFile has been developed to help eliminate “measure explosion”, and to assist in the performance of the Dynatrace Server. 

The program will scan and process all dashboards, alerts, incidents, etc.. 
and tell you how many times a measure is being used (0 - # of occurrences). 

You are then able to sort the data, save it off, and delete the measures with zero uses.
